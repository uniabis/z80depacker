;  Speed-optimized ZX0 decompressor by spke (187 bytes)
;
;  ver.00 by spke (27/01-23/03/2021, 191 bytes)
;  ver.01 by spke (24/03/2021, 193(+2) bytes - fixed a bug in the initialization)
;  ver.01patch2 by uniabis (25/03/2021, 191(-2) bytes - fixed a bug with elias over 8bits)
;  ver.01patch9 by uniabis (10/09/2021, 187(-4) bytes - support for new v2 format)
;
;  Original ZX0 decompressors were written by Einar Saukas
;
;  This decompressor was written on the basis of "Standard" decompressor by
;  Einar Saukas and optimized for speed by spke. This decompressor is
;  about 5% faster than the "Turbo" decompressor, which is 128 bytes long.
;  It has about the same speed as the 412 bytes version of the "Mega" decompressor.
;
;  The decompressor uses AF, BC, DE, HL and IX and relies upon self-modified code.
;
;  The decompression is done in the standard way:
;
;  ld hl,FirstByteOfCompressedData
;  ld de,FirstByteOfMemoryForDecompressedData
;  call DecompressZX0
;
;  Of course, ZX0 compression algorithms are (c) 2021 Einar Saukas,
